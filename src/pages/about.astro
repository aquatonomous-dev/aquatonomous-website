            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The mechanical team is responsible for creating a buoyant and stable ASV hull, and designing the propulsion system. The hull must comply with Roboboat competition rules: no more than six feet in length, four feet in width, and no heavier than 75 lbs. They also ensure that all components used by other teams are waterproof, ready for in-water testing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">
              Additionally, they design a simple transport cart for the hull, often in a quick hackathon session of just three hours!

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">‚ö°Electrical</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The electrical team focuses on designing an efficient sensor suite while minimizing costs, integrating the payload computer with onboard sensors, and implementing a robust e-stop safety system with both physical and remote access.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">
              They also collaborate with the mechanical team to ensure smooth motor control for propulsion.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üß†Autonomy and Perception</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The perception and autonomy teams work closely to enable intelligent navigation. Perception handles mapping, localization, and obstacle detection using a custom sensor suite, built in collaboration with the electrical team. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">
               Since no map is provided at Roboboat, the ASV must generate its own in real time. This data feeds into the autonomy team's algorithms for path and behavior planning. Starting with methods like A*, PID control, and rule-based logic, the system is designed to evolve toward more adaptive, robust decision-making over time.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The Systems Integration team ensures seamless communication between software, hardware, and onboard systems, acting as the connective tissue of the ASV. This team configures and maintains ROS-based infrastructure, telemetry systems, and firmware like MAVROS and Pixhawk, enabling real-time coordination between perception, autonomy, and actuation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">
              This team is critical to reliable field performance and iterative testing, especially as the platform scales in complexity.
